    "\n",
    "Different naïve Bayes models differ in their distributional assumptions about $\\textcolor{orange}{p(\\text{message}\\ |\\ C=c)}$. We represent a message using a **binary** [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model. Specifically, a message is represented as a set of $k$ keywords, that is, $message = (w_1, ..., w_k)$, where $w_i = 1$ if the  keyword $w_i$ appears in the message and $w_i = 0$ otherwise. In this particular assignment we have $k=54$ keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the $p(w_1, ..., w_k |\\ C=c)$ follows a [multinomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution) for each class. Don't let the name scare you, this model simply assigns probabilities to different counts of events with multiple outcomes. So for example: \"I roll a biased six-sided die six times, what is the probability that I get each side occurring exactly once\" is a question that can be answered with a multinomial distribution. You don't need to understand all of the equations on the Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a naïve Bayes model, we assume conditional indepence of keywords given the class, i.e., $p(w_1, ..., w_k |\\ C=c) = \\prod_{i=1}^k p(w_i |\\ C=c)$. Intuitively, we assume that the words of a message were \"drawn\" independently from a bag of $k$ different words. Depending on the class membership $c$, each keyword $w$ has a probability $\\theta_{c, w}$ of being drawn. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\theta_{spam, w}$ will have high value for $w \\in \\{$bank, transfer, buy,... $\\}$.\n",
    "* $\\theta_{ham, w}$ will have high value for $w \\in \\{$paper, conference, proposal, experiment,... $\\}$, if the training data was mostly gathered from emails of researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, the probability of a whole message (it is also called *likelihood*), given that it belongs to class $c$, is then proportional to\n",

    "Probability computation often involves taking a product of many terms (as in our case we need to take a product of $k$ terms of keyword probabilities and the prior probability of the class). Each term would be less than 1 as it represent some probability. When we multiply several terms less than 1, we can end up dealing with very small numbers close to 0, which is not a good idea when processing numbers on a computer. Using the logarithm in this case helps in two folds: (i) the logarithm of a product is a sum of the logarithms, i.e., we are dealing with summation of numbers rather than multiplication, which is much easier from the numerical stability point of view, (ii) the logarithm converts probabilities that are numbers from $[0, 1]$ into numbers from $(-\\infty, 0]$, so that we do not process very small numbers close to 0.\n",
